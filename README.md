### 1.) Thrixty Player for Wordpress
This Wordpress plugin is using shortcodes to generate Thrixty Player Elements.
You can define default options that will help you displaying your objects in the same fashion.

### 2.) Base Repository
This project is built upon the [Thrixty Player](https://github.com/FuchsEDV/Thrixty).

If you need some example files, download the "example"-folder from [here](https://github.com/FuchsEDV/Thrixty_Example).

### 3.) Installation
* Download, unpack and activate this Plugin.
* In the Wordpress-backend go to Settings -> Thrixty Player
* Read the description to the Options, to know what the options are and what they are doing. (At the moment the plugin is only available in german.)
* Save your Options.
* Create a new unpublished page, so you can privately examine how this Plugin works.
* In the TinyMCE Editor should now be a new Button. It is blue and shows the 360Shots Logo.
* Press this and fill in the blanks. Options that you already set, are overwriteable, in case you need specific settings.
* After pressing "Generate" you should see a Shortcode like this: `[thrixty basepath="example" (...)]`
* Save the Changes and preview the Page.
* At this point you should propably have something like "Firebug" (for Firefox) installed. There are different programs for each Browser. In case something went wrong, you need to be able to view your console, as Thrixty logs its errors in there.
* When everything went good, you should now look at your rotating object.

### 4.) Usage
######Mouse/Touch:
```txt
[Click/Tap](single) => Play/Pause
[Click/Tap](double) => Zoom on/off
[Drag/Swipe] => Stop automatic rotation and turn the object. Works also in Zoom mode.
```
######Keboard:
(To use these, the Player needs to be focused - click once inside the Player.)
```txt
[Spacebar] => Play/Pause
[Arrow Left] => Step Backward
[Arrow Right] => Step Forward
[Arrow Up] => Increase Speed
[Arrow Down] => Decrease Speed
[F] => Fullscreen on/off
[ESC] => Stop Zoom, Rotation, Fullscreen all at once.
```
